# Python plays piano tiles

As a mood refresher i though to make the crack piano tiles game using Python and Open CV

So today i was bored from using Youtube and listening to Mozart and thought what if i was able to create Music. !
Sadly I'm no good guitarist or a pianist... But thank God i'm Pythonist ! So i sat for an hour and used the online piano tiles game at  ![http://tanksw.com/piano-tiles/]( Piano Tiles online)

So you guys have definitely seen the arduino plays Piano tiles and we all know that who cares to do that much hardwork when we have Python !

For this project i used  :-
- openCv
- Python
- Python Imaging Library

. The code is very simple, it finds the maximum contour in the image and considers it as the piano tile that has to bbe clicked.
Then it instructs the mouse to click at the defined location and this keeps on going until you close the game or you lose which is very rare.
The speed this which the computer plays is astonishing also i feel the browser loosens up the game in future.
If you want to see more such experiments then please subscibe my Youtube and also watch my video.. i need your support
