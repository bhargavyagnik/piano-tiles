So today i was bored from using Youtube and listening to Mozart and thought what if i was able to create Music. !
Sadly I'm no good guitarist or a pianist... But thank God i'm Pythonist ! So i sat for an hour and used the online piano tiles game at  ![ http://tanksw.com/piano-tiles/ ]( Piano Tiles online)

As a mood refresher i thought to crack piano tiles game using Python and Open CV

So you guys have definitely seen the arduino plays Piano tiles and we all know that who cares to do that much hardwork when we have Python !

For this project i used  :-
- openCv
- Python
- Python Imaging Library

The code is very simple, it finds the maximum contour in the image and considers it as the piano tile that has to be clicked.
Then it instructs the mouse to click at the defined location and this keeps on going until you close the game or you lose which is very rare.
The speed this which the computer plays is astonishing also i feel the browser loosens up the game when the speed increases.

Check out my the video on youtube ..
